## Discussion with TA:
UML with just static checking might not be enough

We need to think of other use cases or user story requirements to augment our project idea

A suggestion from TA is to add interactivity to the UML diagram; when clicking on a method, show the flow of data and control in a tree like visualization. Ex. Which functions classes or modules get executed for a given input

We can have visualization (UML DIAGRAM) with static checking, and also reason about dynamic properties (the tree like visualization described above)

## Things to do by next milestone
Brainstorm more use cases and settle on an idea
