## Sample Results
Refer to [this file](docs/running_samples.md) for how to run our provided sample code

The following is the static and dynamic renders of `samplecode/selected_benchmarks/deltablue` from the command executed in `/backend/` 

`python main.py -d '../samplecode/selected_benchmarks/deltablue/' '../samplecode/selected_benchmarks/deltablue/deltablue.py'` 

and 

`python main.py -s '../samplecode/selected_benchmarks/deltablue/'`
